# Other notes

What I would like to be included in the Lazy Developer Manifesto, but then I felt it didn't really fit into the overall structure.

## What is lazy?

There are several types of lazy developers so it should be specified which kind of lazy is meant here. 

There are three types of lazy developers: 

 1. Those who donâ€™t do anything at all. These are usually fired or become managers. This manifesto is not about them.
 2. Those who, when given a task, are too lazy to think and do it in the most straightforward, brute-force, copy-paste way. This manifesto is not about them
 3. Those who when given a task are too lazy to code and try to be creative in doing as little work as possible. These are the lazy developers this manifesto is about.

I'm not the first one to come up with laziness being a developer virtue.

## Other considerations of a lazy developer

 - When given 5 minutes to chop a tree, spend 3 minutes sharpening your axe
 - Overtime does not make you more productive (actually in reverse)
 - Constant overtiming means you can't manage your time correctly
 - Work smart, not hard
 - DRY (don't repeat yourself)
