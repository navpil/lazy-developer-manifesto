Manifesto compiled by Dmytro Polovinkin.

Since this manifesto is a list of a common known practices 
I do not see any point in licesing it and since I am not a 
lawyer I even do not know if I am even allowed to do so.

Since I received all ideas from the Public Domain it is
fair to assume that this is a Public Domain work too.
